Who am I?

I am a book enthusiast, a diligent Neuroscience researcher, a professional industrial designer, overthinker, hard worker, music addicted, and believer in Grail.

Having been inspired by the most important people who were pioneers in science, history, and discovery, I have been learning, thinking, experiencing, and developing myself to become a professional research student.

Right now, I am working on programming using Python and MATLAB. Looking forward to making new friends with whom they are working on interdisciplinary research.

Feel free to contact me.
